#### Guidelines 
- The idea is to have one class per question (how to do X?).
- Questions are sorted into categories (= directories).
- Keep each solution as simple and short as possible.
- Each solution is represented as a static method.
- The solutions can directly be executed via main method.
- Comments are used to explain what exactly the code is doing.
